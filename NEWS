Version 2.0, 2015-06-20

* new module: ldap

* mailutils: Requires 2.99.98 or later


Version 1.1, 2010-07-03

* New configuration statements

- prepend-load-path

Adds specified path at the beginning of the current load path

- append-load-path

Sinonym to `load-path'

* `Key' condition

New dispatch condition `key' compares key with the given pattern.  As
with `map' three kinds of comparison are supported: literal, globbing
pattern and regular expression.

* Transform capability

Transform capability is an optional feature provided by some
databases.  It allows for transforming requests following certain
rules.

Transforms are requested in dispatch rules, e.g.:

   dispatch key like <*>   transform key dequote

This rule applies to any request which has its key enclosed in
angle brackets.  It applies the transformation method `dequote'
(which should be defined prior to this statement) to the
key.  After the method returns, scanning dispatch rules is
resumed with the modified key value.

* New module `sed'

This module allows to modify queries using sed-like expressions.
For example, the declaration of the `dequote' database, used in
the example above, could be:

# Load the sed module
module sed sed
# Dequote database: removes angle brackets surrounding the argument
database dequote sed 's/<(.*)>/\1/'

* New module `mysql'

Provides an interface to MySQL DBMS.

* New module `postgres'

Provides an interface to PostgreSQL DBMS.
